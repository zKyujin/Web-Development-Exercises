<!-- CSS selectors are attributes that selects a certain amount elements to change.
for example, if I use h1 [color:red], it'll change all my h1's to red, but what should I do
if I want to change just one or a specific amount?
That's the function of css selectors:
Class selector: It's function is to assign a class to various elements, so you can change a certain amount at once
like this: h1 class="red-text">teste</h1>
.red-text {
    color:red;
}

Id Selector: It's function is the same as a class selector, but each id assigns just one element.
h1 id="red-text">teste</h1>
.id="red-text"{
    color:red;
}

DRAGGABLE SELECTOR: <h1 draggable="true">Drag me </h1>
                    p[draggable="true"] {
                        color:blue;
                    }
                    <h1draggable="false">Don't drag me </h1>
                    p[draggable="false"] {
                        color:red;
                    }
            
Universal selector (*): apply the changes to all elements, independent of what classes selectors you had used.
* {
    color:red;
}
